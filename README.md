Project Description

The Quantum Circuit Simulator is a simple web-based application that allows users to design and simulate basic quantum circuits. Using JavaScript and HTML/CSS, users can add quantum gates, simulate their effects on qubits, and measure outcomes in real-time. The project is designed to be intuitive, interactive, and educational, providing a foundation for understanding quantum computing concepts like superposition, entanglement, and gate operations.

Features

1. Add Quantum Gates

Users can add the following gates:

Hadamard (H): Creates superposition.

Pauli-X (X): Flips the qubit state.

Pauli-Y (Y): Applies a π rotation around the Y-axis.

Pauli-Z (Z): Applies a phase flip.

Phase (S): Applies a phase shift.

T-Gate (T): Applies a π/4 phase shift.

CNOT: A controlled-NOT gate affecting two qubits.




2. Simulate Circuit

As gates are added, the circuit simulation updates automatically, reflecting the changes to qubit states.



3. Measure Qubits

Allows measurement of the qubit states, collapsing the superposition to |0⟩ or |1⟩ randomly.



4. Reset Circuit

Resets the circuit and qubits to their initial states.



5. Interactive Interface

Simple button-based interface for adding gates and controlling the simulation.



6. Real-time Feedback

Displays the circuit and qubit states dynamically.
